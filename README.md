# PlateReaderCorrection
Set of programs to correct for the Absorbance in 48-wells plates to Optical Density (PathLength = 1 cm). These programs use as input the ANSI file generated by "Dr. Marco Siderius' plate reader". Once the program is running, the user will be asked for the volume of in the wells and the duration of the kinetic cycles to generate an output. Depending on the program that has been chosen, the user will obtain a .csv or a .tsv files, both accepted by Microsoft Excel for an easy analysis of the results.
